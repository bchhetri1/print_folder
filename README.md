# printAfolder
When a file is put on a folder, it is sent to the printer. 

NOTE: Not all files are printer friendly. However, most printers will accept pdfs and post scripts. CUPS filters will easily convert certain
file types appropriately, so if a file isn't printed (such as .rtf, .txt, etc.) consider converting it to PDF or PS before putting it in the folder.
